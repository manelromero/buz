						<h2>Landing page and online marketing starter pack</h2>

						<p>Which includes A/B landing page testing, search engine campaign and social media campaign. Selection of the right channel will depend on your needs which we will identify together during your free assessment call. You will be able to test the market first and to understand if there is a demand for your product online.</p>
						<p>Even after building an effective website you would very likely need to advertise your services. Why? Because when users are searching for information online you may have noticed that first results they get are results which belong to massive informational sites rather than individual products or services. In order to have a chance to be shown on the first page of results organically you would need to invest a lot of time in writing good quality, useful and unique content for your website.</p>
						<p>A simpler and a quicker way to be displayed on the first page of search results is to start advertising online. And online advertising is the most effective way to bring customers to your business because:</p>
						<p>1. You can target your audience exactly. There is no wasted budget as with offline or TV ads. Say you are a real estate agency and only want to advertise to those who are looking to buy a house in your town. We will setup your ads to be shown to only those people who are looking to buy a house in your area. And you will be displayed among the first search results online for those queries! Or even a better deal, say you own a restaurant and you would like to advertise to those potential clients who are located 1 mile away from your business between 18.00 and 22.00 and looking for a nice place to eat nearby on his/her mobile device. You can do it and we are here to help!</p>
						<p>2. You will control your spend. You can set limited budget at first to test the market and ads performance, but on the long run as long as you are making positive ROI (return on investment) and as long as there is a demand for your service or a product, it should not matter too much. What we want to say is as long as the profit you will make is higher than the cost of the ads, there is no reason to limit your budget. And we will help you to understand your numbers.</p>
						<p>And of course in order to make sure that your clients will find it easy to understand what your service or product is about and to make a purchase or a sign up process easy for them, we will  create a set of 2 Landing pages for your website. Your online ads will link to these pages and after a month or two you will be able to choose the one which will perform better and keep it.</p>

						<h2>Online marketing PRO pack</h2>

					</div>

				</section>

				<section>

					<div class="article-content">
						<p>Once you will gain your first success online, we will help you to replicate it on other marketing channels. We will take the learnings about your customers received through the primary marketing channel and replicate your success on the other ones. Say, that after running your ads on Google AdWords for some time you will learn that majority of your clients are over 50 years of age and based in US. You will be able to target this user base on Facebook, Linkedin Bing and Yahoo right away.</p>
						<p>And as you will continue your journey towards success we will be by your side to optimize your results and marketing spend, help you to analyze the statistics in order to make right decisions and of course grow with you. We want to gain your trust and to establish long term relationships with you. We are interested in seeing you succeed as your success will mean our success too! And when you are ready to expand and to go ahead with opening other franchise units or offices for your business we want to be by your side helping you to bring your business to the next level and to truly blossom.</p>
